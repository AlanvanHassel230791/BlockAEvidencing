1948, William Grey, Elmer and Elsie

First autonomous robots, also known as tortoises

Two simple threewheeled robots who looked alive but had no brains

Made from left over war materials and old alarm clocks

Only visual and touch sensor and simple on/off reflexes



They could explore rooms, dance and return to their hutches to recharge

They show that you don’t need inner experience/complicated processor to do complex things; even the simplest responses to a complex world can result in complicated behaviour

Without things to run into and react to, their behaviour would be predictable and boring. But with the right environment, complex and interesting behaviour can emerge

maybe, just like Elsie and Elmer, the only reason why we’re interesting is because we have a world full of stuff
and people to bump up against, an environment in which we can discover ourselves.


In one experiment a light was placed on the nose of one of the tortoises. It appeared that the robot was looking at itself in a mirror. Its light began flickering and the robot started shaking as if excited to see itself in the mirror. Walter argued that if this behavior were seen in an animal it "might be accepted as evidence of some degree of self-awareness."
